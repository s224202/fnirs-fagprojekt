# fnirs fagprojekt
This repository contains all the code for our project as part of the dtu project 02466. Some parts of the project are largely unused, but preserved nonetheless. The code contains a large variety of filters that collectively or separetly can be used to process fNIRS data. 



All code is written by the authors of the project, expect where otherwise stated(mostly the Scripts/ folder).
